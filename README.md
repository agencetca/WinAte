My goal is to provide an easy way to migrate from Windows 7/8 to GNU/Linux, without having a high end pc. Everything is done using the less resource-intensive software available, always trying to keep as much functionality as possible.
It is meant to be used in LXDE/Openbox, so don't expect to have neither rounded corners nor exactly the same look and feel as in Windows. That's not even a secondary goal.


Requirements:

- LXPanel
- LXSession (>= 0.4.9)(icons, gtk theme and cursor)
- PCManFM (wallpaper)
- Compton
- Openbox
- SLiM (for login screen)

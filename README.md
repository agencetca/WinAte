My goal is to provide an easy way to migrate from Windows 7 to GNU/Linux, without having a high end pc. Everything is done using the less resource-intensive software available, always trying to keep as much functionality as possible.


Requirements:

- LXPanel
- LXSession (>= 0.4.9)(icons, gtk theme and cursor)
- PCManFM (wallpaper)
- Compton
- Openbox
